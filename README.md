# Sleep_Study_Regression
## Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between sleep habits, stress, and academic performance using a regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset is survey-based and includes information on sleep duration, concentration difficulty, stress levels, and self-reported academic performance.

## Approach
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature and target selection
- Ordinal encoding of survey responses
- Linear Regression model training
- Model evaluation

## Model & Evaluation
- Model: Linear Regression
- Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Notes
Due to the subjective nature of survey data, modest R² values are expected. MAE is used to assess prediction quality.
